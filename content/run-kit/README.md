**Your tmux, in the browser and on your phone.** run-kit is a remote console for the machine you actually work on — every tmux session and pane as a live terminal, in a sidebar, from your desk or your couch. It's the modern, terminal-native answer to the old server web-console: nothing to configure, no database, state read straight from tmux.

What makes it sing in 2026 is what you tend to run in those panes: **AI coding agents, many at once.** `rk riff` spawns each one in its own [git worktree](https://github.com/sahil87/wt), and the dashboard lets you watch the whole fleet. But run-kit never wraps the agent — a pane is just a pane. It's equally a build, a REPL, an ssh session, `htop`. **The agent is one of the things you run, not the thing run-kit is.** That's the point: when the agent tooling churns underneath you (and it does, monthly), the terminal layer stays put.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://shll.ai/install | sh
```

Installs the entire shll toolkit via Homebrew, handling tap trust automatically. run-kit relies on its sibling tools (`wt` for the riff worktree flow), so the full-toolkit install is the supported path.

## Quick start

From install to a working dashboard with one agent running. Two front doors to the same dashboard — pick one:

**In the browser** (any platform):

```bash
run-kit daemon start            # start the dashboard daemon on :3000
open http://localhost:3000      # open the dashboard in your browser
```

**Or the desktop app** (macOS):

```bash
run-kit desktop install         # once: install Run Kit.app to /Applications, quarantine-free
open -a "Run Kit"               # then click "Start & connect" — the app starts the daemon for you
```

The app's welcome page detects your local install and starts the daemon in one click — no `daemon start` needed. It can also connect to run-kit on other machines, including bootstrapping one over SSH (see [Desktop app](#desktop-app-macos)).

Either way, spawn your first agent workspace:

```bash
run-kit agent-setup             # optional, once per machine: agent busy/waiting/idle in the dashboard

# in a tmux session (tmux new -s work if you aren't in one):
run-kit riff                    # spawn an agent workspace (--skill /name picks the slash-command)
```

`run-kit riff` also needs [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt) on your `PATH` — included with the full-toolkit install, or `shll install wt` — and your agent CLI available. When something fails, `run-kit doctor` prints per-dependency status.

The new workspace appears in the sidebar; click into it to drive the agent — or any command — from the dashboard.

The formula also installs `rk` as a fully interchangeable short alias of `run-kit`, so every command here works the same whether you type `run-kit` or `rk`.

To upgrade later, run `run-kit update` — pulls the latest version via Homebrew and restarts the daemon so the new binary takes effect immediately. The desktop app updates separately: `run-kit desktop update`, or the app's **Restart to Update** menu item when it detects a new release.

> **Coming from the old `rk` formula?** run-kit was originally published as `sahil87/tap/rk`. If brew warns that `sahil87/tap/rk was renamed to sahil87/tap/run-kit`, you have a keg installed under the old name — remove it with a benign `brew uninstall sahil87/tap/rk` (your config and the `rk` command alias are unaffected), then `brew install sahil87/tap/run-kit` if `run-kit` is no longer on your `PATH`.

See the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md) for prerequisites, `run-kit doctor`, development setup, and driving run-kit from your phone over Tailscale HTTPS.

## What run-kit is (and isn't)

|  | run-kit |
|--|---------|
| **It is** | A remote, phone-first **console for your tmux** — agent-agnostic, no database, state derived from tmux + filesystem. A spawner (`run-kit riff`) and a dashboard (`run-kit serve`) that compose. |
| **It isn't** | An agent wrapper. It doesn't speak any agent's protocol, parse any agent's output, or care what's in the pane. That's deliberate — it's what makes it outlive whichever agent you run. |

## Why run-kit?

- **A remote terminal console, not an agent wrapper** — run-kit exposes your tmux, full stop. Drive an agent in one pane, a dev server in the next, an ssh session in a third. Because it's agent-agnostic, it outlives whatever coding agent you're running this month.
- **One command per parallel agent** — `run-kit riff` creates a worktree, opens a tmux window in it, and launches your agent. `run-kit riff -N 3` spawns three workspaces in parallel; failures roll back cleanly.
- **Watch a whole fleet, from anywhere** — every tmux session and pane shows up in a sidebar. Click for a live browser terminal; pin several into a [board](#boards--watch-many-panes-at-once) to watch three agents side-by-side; open the same dashboard on your phone over Tailscale.
- **Mobile-first, keyboard-first** — `Cmd+K` command palette is the primary discovery surface. Touch targets are tuned for mobile so you can steer a session from your phone while away from your desk.
- **No database, no daemon magic** — state is derived from tmux and the filesystem, the way a good console mirrors the system it manages. Sessions survive `run-kit` restarts because the daemon never touches them.
- **The dashboard layer over [`fab-kit`](https://github.com/sahil87/fab-kit) and [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt)** — `run-kit riff --skill /fab-fff` launches a full fab-kit pipeline in an isolated worktree. Reach for run-kit when you have more parallel changes than one terminal can hold.

## The mental model

run-kit is two independent halves that compose (the command is `run-kit`; `rk` is the fully interchangeable short alias people tend to type):

```
run-kit riff         run-kit serve
  ▼                    ▼
spawns agent        runs the
workspaces ─────►   browser dashboard
(tmux + worktree)   (watches tmux)
```

You can run either alone. Run `run-kit riff` in any tmux session without ever starting `run-kit serve` — you get the spawning behavior, no dashboard. Run `run-kit serve` and never call `run-kit riff` — you get a tmux browser dashboard for sessions you spawn manually. The two are designed to compose, not depend on each other.

## `run-kit riff` — the spawner

One invocation gives you a git worktree, a tmux window inside it, and one or more panes ready to go. The default pane runs your coding agent, but a pane can run anything — `run-kit riff` is a workspace launcher, not an agent launcher.

**Pane array model.** `--skill` and `--cmd` are repeatable. Each occurrence adds one pane; argv order (left to right) becomes pane order. Bare `--skill` opens a blank agent session; bare `--cmd` drops into `$SHELL`.

**Layouts.** `auto` (default), `tiled`, `even-horizontal`, `even-vertical`, `main-horizontal`, `main-vertical`. Set with `--layout`.

**Presets.** Common pane/layout combos go in `fab/project/config.yaml` under `riff.presets.<name>`. Invoke as `run-kit riff <name>` or `run-kit riff --preset <name>`.

**Parallel.** `-N <N>` spawns N workspaces in parallel; failures roll back successful ones before exiting.

**wt passthrough.** Flags after `--` go to `wt create` verbatim (e.g. `--base`, `--reuse`, `--worktree-name`).

Examples:

```bash
run-kit riff                                         # 1 pane, default skill (/fab-discuss)
run-kit riff --skill /fab-fff                        # 1 pane, specific slash-command
run-kit riff --skill /fab-fff --cmd "just dev"       # 2 panes (agent + dev server)
run-kit riff --skill /a --cmd x --cmd y --layout main-vertical
run-kit riff ship                                    # invoke the 'ship' preset
run-kit riff ship -N 3                               # 3 parallel ship workspaces
run-kit riff -- --worktree-name pacing-canyon        # name the worktree
```

**Prerequisites:** must be inside a tmux session, [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt) on `PATH`, and the launcher (default `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) available. Override the launcher per-project via `agent.spawn_command` in `fab/project/config.yaml` — point it at any agent CLI, or any command at all.

See the [riff guide](docs/site/workflows.md) for the full reference.

## `run-kit serve` — the HTTP server

Start the HTTP server in the foreground. Configurable via `RK_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and `RK_PORT` (default `3000`).

```bash
run-kit serve                                # foreground on 127.0.0.1:3000
RK_HOST=0.0.0.0 RK_PORT=8080 run-kit serve   # bind all interfaces, port 8080
```

To run it in the background, use the `run-kit daemon` subcommands:

```bash
run-kit daemon start                         # background daemon in a tmux session
run-kit daemon restart                       # stop and start
run-kit daemon stop                          # graceful shutdown
run-kit daemon status                        # show daemon state and port owner
```

The daemon runs in its own dedicated tmux server (`rk-daemon`), completely separate from your sessions. Restart the daemon and everything you're running keeps running — the console reconnects automatically.

The daemon also starts a managed **code-server** beside it (its own `rk-code-server` tmux session on the same socket), powering the dashboard's `code` lens and CODE panel surface — a full editor at the window's git root, served same-origin behind the stable `/code/` route. It binds loopback-only on `RK_PORT+2`; set `RK_CODE_SERVER_PORT` only to point rk at an externally managed instance instead. `run-kit daemon stop` deliberately leaves code-server running; `run-kit doctor` reports its presence and reachability.

## Status dots — read every window at a glance

Each window in the sidebar, dashboard, and pane panel carries a single **status dot** that tells the window's **local story** — which journey runs in the pane and how healthy it is — using two orthogonal channels, plus a right-edge **PR glyph** for the remote story:

- **Hue = journey**: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/building-60a5fa?label=) fab **building** (intake/apply/review) → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PR--ready-9ece6a?label=) fab **PR-ready / done** (ship/review-pr/done) · ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/agent-facc15?label=) an ad-hoc agent. A plain window is gray — color is reserved for a journey.
- **Shape = status** (health), the same meaning in every hue: **solid** = running/live · **ring** = at rest (stage pending, parked done, idle agent) · **dotted ring + red center** = failed.
- **PR glyph** (right edge): the branch's PR on GitHub — green open · yellow checks running · red failing · purple merged · gray draft. The dot never renders PR state.

![StatusDot compositional reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahil87/run-kit/main/docs/img/status-dot-reference.svg)

See the [status dot reference](docs/site/status-dot.md) for the full legend, the per-state rendering, and the design rationale.

## Agent state — `run-kit agent-setup`

Windows running an AI agent can report a live lifecycle state in the sidebar and pane panel: **active** (turn in progress), **waiting** (blocked on you — a permission prompt or question), or **idle** (turn done, with elapsed duration). `waiting` is the state worth a glance at your phone: the agent isn't working, it's waiting for *you*.

This is opt-in and needs a one-time setup per machine:

```bash
run-kit agent-setup              # shows the settings diff, asks before writing
run-kit agent-setup --uninstall  # removes exactly the run-kit-owned entries
```

It installs agent-harness hooks into your user-global agent config (v1: Claude Code, `~/.claude/settings.json`) that stamp a `@rk_agent_state` tmux pane option on lifecycle events. Each hook is a thin, stable wrapper that delegates to `run-kit agent-hook` — a stable interface whose logic (the pid resolution, the value write) lives in the binary. No run-kit **server** is needed at fire time, and because the logic is in the binary, hook fixes track `brew upgrade run-kit` with no settings changes and no session restarts. They work for any session, in any repo, under any workflow. Idempotent: re-running updates run-kit's entries in place (recognizing and replacing older-generation entries too) and never touches your other hooks. Until it's run (and agents are restarted so new sessions pick up the hooks), agent state shows `—`.

> **Upgrading from an earlier run-kit?** Older installs had the hook *logic* inlined in `settings.json`. Run `run-kit agent-setup` once more to swap in the new delegating wrapper, then restart your agent sessions (harnesses snapshot hook config at session start). This is the last time a hook *logic* change needs a re-setup — future fixes ship in the binary. (Changes to which events map to which state still need a re-setup, since that mapping lives in the settings entries.)

The cross-repo convention is documented in [`docs/specs/agent-state.md`](https://github.com/sahil87/run-kit/blob/main/docs/specs/agent-state.md).

## Boards — watch many panes at once

A **board** is a named, cross-server pane dashboard. Pin any tmux window from any server into a board, and the board renders all pinned panes side-by-side in a horizontally-scrollable layout — perfect for watching three parallel agent sessions, or comparing a `just dev` server's output against the agent that's editing it.

Three ways to pin a window to a board:

1. **Sidebar pin icon** — every window row in the sidebar has a pin icon. Click it to open a popover listing existing boards (click to pin/unpin), plus a "Pin to new board…" input that creates a new board on first pin.
2. **Command palette (`Cmd+K`)** — `Board: Pin Current Window`, `Board: Unpin Current Window`, `Board: Switch to <name>`, `Board: Leave Board View`.
3. **Board pane header** — each pinned pane shows an unpin button in its header for one-click removal.

Inside a board:

- **`Cmd+]` / `Cmd+[`** cycles pane focus to the next / previous pane (wraps).
- **Click a pane** to focus it; keystrokes route to that pane's terminal.
- **Drag the pane edge** to resize (desktop only; widths persist per-board in `localStorage`).
- **On mobile**, panes render as a single-pane swipe carousel.

Pin state lives in tmux (via the `@rk_board` window option) so it follows the window, not the browser — open the same board URL on your phone and you see the same panes. Pane widths are intentionally local to each device.

## Drive it from your phone (HTTPS over Tailscale)

Some browser features (clipboard, secure context) require HTTPS. Accessing run-kit from another machine on your tailnet also requires HTTPS:

1. Enable HTTPS at [DNS > HTTPS Certificates](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns).
2. Run `tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:3000`.
3. Open `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` on your phone or another laptop.

For a stable custom hostname or public access via Funnel, see the [Tailscale guide](docs/site/install.md).

## Desktop app (macOS)

A native desktop shell — an Electron window that wraps your dashboard and frees the browser-reserved `⌘` keyboard tier for run-kit itself. Install and update it with the CLI:

```sh
run-kit desktop install    # fetch the latest release DMG, install to /Applications
run-kit desktop update     # same, but a no-op when already current
run-kit desktop status     # installed vs latest version (read-only)
```

Installing through the CLI matters: the desktop DMGs are ad-hoc signed (no notarization), so a **browser** download gets stamped with `com.apple.quarantine` and Gatekeeper blocks the app on every install and every update ("Apple could not verify…"). Quarantine is applied by the *downloading application* — command-line tools don't apply it — so `run-kit desktop install` produces a quarantine-free install that opens cleanly, first time and every time. The installer does its own verification instead: it checks the DMG's SHA256 against the GitHub release digest (when available) and runs `codesign --verify --deep --strict` on the app before installing.

Once installed, the app's welcome page replaces the terminal steps for getting connected, in three rungs:

- **This Mac** — detects your local install and daemon state; one **Start & connect** button starts the daemon (when needed) and connects. Afterwards, daemon control lives in the menu under **Hosts → Local Daemon** (Connect / Restart / Stop).
- **Over SSH** — type `user@host` and the app registers it via [`run-kit remote`](#command-reference), installs run-kit on the machine if missing, starts its daemon, and opens a tunnel — a remote host with zero manual setup on the box.
- **A URL** — point at any reachable `run-kit serve` instance (e.g. a Tailscale HTTPS endpoint).

The app never starts, stops, or updates anything on its own — every daemon action is an explicit click, and your tmux sessions survive all of them (the daemon layer never touches your sessions).

**Manual fallback** (no run-kit CLI on the machine): download the DMG for your architecture from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sahil87/run-kit/releases), drag **Run Kit.app** into Applications, then clear the quarantine flag — via System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**, or:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Run Kit.app"
```

The manual route repeats that dance on every update; the CLI path never needs it.

## Push notifications

Any process on the box can push a real OS-level notification to your phone or
desktop — even when the RunKit PWA tab is **closed** — via Web Push:

```sh
run-kit notify "deploy finished" --title "CI"
```

`run-kit notify` POSTs to the local server, which fans the message out to every
subscribed browser using the Web Push protocol (signed with a server-side VAPID
key persisted under `~/.rk/`). It is **fail-silent**: if the server is
unreachable or returns an error it exits 0 and prints nothing, so it never
stalls a calling script or agent loop.

**Opt in from the browser**: click the **bell icon** in the top bar (or open the
command palette with `Cmd+K` and run **Notifications: Enable push**). This
requests notification permission and subscribes the current device. There is no
settings page — the bell dropdown and the palette are the opt-in gestures. The
bell dropdown also offers **Send test notification** (a local test that bypasses
the server) and a **Notifications help** link.

See the [notifications guide](docs/site/notifications.md) for setup and the
common "it says sent but nothing appears" troubleshooting (almost always an
OS-level notification block — e.g. macOS Focus mode).

> **Secure-context requirement**: Web Push (service worker + `PushManager`)
> only works in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) —
> that means **HTTPS or `localhost`**. Hitting run-kit on `localhost:3000` or behind
> a TLS reverse proxy (e.g. `tailscale serve`, see
> [Drive it from your phone](#drive-it-from-your-phone-https-over-tailscale))
> both qualify. Over plain HTTP to a remote host, the browser silently refuses
> to register the service worker and the **Enable push** command will report
> that a secure context is required.

## Shell completion

`run-kit shell-init <shell>` emits eval-safe tab-completion for your shell (it registers completion for both `run-kit` and the `rk` alias). Add this line to your rc file:

```sh
eval "$(run-kit shell-init zsh)"   # in ~/.zshrc
eval "$(run-kit shell-init bash)"  # in ~/.bashrc
```

Supports `zsh`, `bash`, `fish`, and `powershell`. Completion-only — run-kit has no shell function wrapper; every subcommand is reached via `run-kit <subcommand>` (or the `rk` alias).

> 💡 Have other shll tools? [`shll shell-install`](https://github.com/sahil87/shll#shll-shell-install--wire-the-rc-file-recommended) handles all of their shell integrations and autocompletions at once.

## Command reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `run-kit riff` | Create a worktree + tmux window + agent/command pane(s). |
| `run-kit serve` | Start the HTTP server (foreground or daemon). |
| `run-kit status` | Show a tmux session summary. |
| `run-kit url` | Print the run-kit server URL (config-derived from `RK_HOST`/`RK_PORT`, default `http://127.0.0.1:3000`) — a heuristic for AI agents, not a liveness probe. |
| `run-kit skill` | Print the agent skill bundle — a static usage briefing for agents operating run-kit (canonical source `docs/site/skill.md`); `run-kit skill display` prints the visual-display topic page. |
| `run-kit notify` | Send a Web Push notification to your subscribed devices (see [Push notifications](#push-notifications)). Fail-silent. |
| `run-kit doctor` | Check runtime dependencies. Run this first when something breaks. |
| `run-kit agent-setup` | Install agent-harness hooks (v1: Claude Code) so panes report busy/waiting/idle state (see [Agent state](#agent-state--run-kit-agent-setup)), plus the tmux guard shim that blocks `tmux kill-server` without an explicit `-L`/`-S` socket. Once per machine; `--uninstall` reverses both. |
| `run-kit init-conf` | Scaffold default `tmux.conf` and `tmux.d/` drop-in directory to `~/.rk/`. Optional. |
| `run-kit update` | Upgrade via Homebrew and restart the daemon. |
| `run-kit desktop` | Install/update the macOS desktop app from GitHub Releases, quarantine-free (`install`, `update`, `status` — see [Desktop app](#desktop-app-macos)). |
| `run-kit remote` | Use SSH-only machines as run-kit hosts — register, bootstrap, tunnel, connect (`add`, `connect`, `list`, `status`, `disconnect`, `remove`). |
| `run-kit completion` | Generate shell completion scripts (or use `run-kit shell-init` for eval-safe output). |
| `run-kit help` | Help about any command. |

Every command is also reachable via the short `rk` alias (e.g. `rk riff`). Run `run-kit <command> --help` for full flag details, or see the [full command reference](https://shll.ai/tools/run-kit/commands/) for every command and flag.

## Troubleshooting

- **`run-kit riff` fails with "not in a tmux session"** — riff requires `$TMUX` to be set. Start tmux first (`tmux new -s work`), then run `run-kit riff` inside it.
- **`run-kit riff` fails with "wt not found"** — install `wt` via `shll install wt`, or install the full toolkit from [https://shll.ai](https://shll.ai).
- **Agent state shows `—` for every window** — run `run-kit agent-setup` once on the machine, then start a fresh agent session (hooks apply to new sessions, not already-running ones). A pane sitting at a plain shell also reads `—` by design — state clears when the agent exits.
- **Anything else broken** — run `run-kit doctor`. It checks tmux, `wt`, the launcher binary, port availability, and prints per-dependency status.

## Architecture

run-kit's daemon runs in a dedicated tmux server (`rk-daemon`), separate from your sessions (`runkit`). Restarts use kill-and-restart (no polling loop or signal files), are idempotent (`--restart` works whether or not a daemon is running), and never touch your tmux sessions — everything you're running survives daemon restarts unaffected.
