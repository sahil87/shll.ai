`rk riff` spawns AI coding agents in parallel [git worktrees](https://github.com/sahil87/wt). The browser dashboard lets you watch them all — from your desk or your phone.

## Why run-kit?

- **One command per parallel agent** — `rk riff` creates a worktree, opens a tmux window in it, and launches Claude Code. `rk riff -N 3` spawns three workspaces in parallel; failures roll back cleanly.
- **Browser dashboard for tmux** — every tmux session and pane shows up in a sidebar. Click a pane for a live terminal in the browser; open the same dashboard on your phone over Tailscale.
- **Mobile-first, keyboard-first** — `Cmd+K` command palette is the primary discovery surface. Touch targets are tuned for mobile so you can drive an agent session from your phone while away from your desk.
- **No database, no daemon magic** — state is derived from tmux and the filesystem. Agent sessions survive `rk` restarts because the daemon never touches them.
- **The dashboard layer over [`fab-kit`](https://github.com/sahil87/fab-kit) and [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt)** — `rk riff --skill /fab-fff` launches a full fab-kit pipeline in an isolated worktree. Use rk when you have more parallel changes than you can watch in a single terminal.

## The mental model

rk is two independent halves that compose:

```
rk riff              rk serve
  ▼                    ▼
spawns agent        runs the
workspaces ─────►   browser dashboard
(tmux + worktree)   (watches tmux)
```

You can run either alone. Run `rk riff` in any tmux session without ever starting `rk serve` — you get the spawning behavior, no dashboard. Run `rk serve` and never call `rk riff` — you get a tmux browser dashboard for sessions you spawn manually. The two are designed to compose, not depend on each other.

## Quick start

From a clean install to a working dashboard with one agent running:

```bash
brew install sahil87/tap/rk     # install
rk serve -d                     # start the dashboard daemon on :3000
open http://localhost:3000      # open the dashboard in your browser

# in any tmux session:
rk riff --skill /fab-discuss    # spawn an agent workspace
```

The new workspace appears in the dashboard's sidebar; click into it to drive the agent from the browser.

To upgrade later, run `rk update` — pulls the latest version via Homebrew and restarts the daemon so the new binary takes effect immediately.

See the [install & access guide](docs/site/install.md) for prerequisites, `rk doctor`, development setup, and driving rk from your phone over Tailscale HTTPS.

## `rk riff` — the spawner

The headline command. One invocation gives you a git worktree, a tmux window inside it, and one or more Claude Code panes ready to go.

**Pane array model.** `--skill` and `--cmd` are repeatable. Each occurrence adds one pane; argv order (left to right) becomes pane order. Bare `--skill` opens a blank Claude session; bare `--cmd` drops into `$SHELL`.

**Layouts.** `auto` (default), `tiled`, `even-horizontal`, `even-vertical`, `main-horizontal`, `main-vertical`. Set with `--layout`.

**Presets.** Common pane/layout combos go in `fab/project/config.yaml` under `riff.presets.<name>`. Invoke as `rk riff <name>` or `rk riff --preset <name>`.

**Parallel.** `-N <N>` spawns N workspaces in parallel; failures roll back successful ones before exiting.

**wt passthrough.** Flags after `--` go to `wt create` verbatim (e.g. `--base`, `--reuse`, `--worktree-name`).

Examples:

```bash
rk riff                                              # 1 pane, default skill (/fab-discuss)
rk riff --skill /fab-fff                             # 1 pane, specific slash-command
rk riff --skill /fab-fff --cmd "just dev"            # 2 panes (agent + dev server)
rk riff --skill /a --cmd x --cmd y --layout main-vertical
rk riff ship                                         # invoke the 'ship' preset
rk riff ship -N 3                                    # 3 parallel ship workspaces
rk riff -- --worktree-name pacing-canyon             # name the worktree
```

**Prerequisites:** must be inside a tmux session, [`wt`](https://github.com/sahil87/wt) on `PATH`, and the launcher (default `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) available. Override the launcher per-project via `agent.spawn_command` in `fab/project/config.yaml`.

See the [riff guide](docs/site/workflows.md) for the full reference.

## `rk serve` — the dashboard daemon

Start the HTTP server. Configurable via `RK_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and `RK_PORT` (default `3000`).

```bash
rk serve                                # foreground on 127.0.0.1:3000
RK_HOST=0.0.0.0 RK_PORT=8080 rk serve   # bind all interfaces, port 8080
rk serve -d                             # background daemon in a tmux session
rk serve --restart                      # idempotent restart
rk serve --stop                         # graceful shutdown
```

The daemon runs in its own dedicated tmux server (`rk-daemon`), completely separate from your agent sessions. Restart the daemon and your agents keep running — the dashboard reconnects automatically.

## Status dots — read every window at a glance

Each window in the sidebar, dashboard, and pane panel carries a single **status dot** that tells you where it sits in the fab → PR lifecycle and how healthy it is — using two orthogonal channels:

- **Hue = phase** (where in the journey): ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/intake-60a5fa?label=) intake → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/exec-fbbf24?label=) execution (apply/review) + completion (hydrate) → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ship-9ece6a?label=) shipping (ship/review-pr) → ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/pr-c084fc?label=) the live PR. A plain window with no fab change is gray — color is reserved for the journey.
- **Shape = status** (health), one vocabulary across every phase: **ring** = pending · **solid circle** = active/ready · **dashed ring + red center** = failed · **square** = done/merged · **gray ring** = skipped/closed.

Exactly one signal drives the dot, in precedence order **PR > fab > tmux**.

![StatusDot stage × status matrix](docs/img/status-dot-matrix.svg)

See the [status dot reference](docs/site/status-dot.md) for the full matrix, the per-state rendering, and the design rationale.

## Boards — watch many panes at once

A **board** is a named, cross-server pane dashboard. Pin any tmux window from any server into a board, and the board renders all pinned panes side-by-side in a horizontally-scrollable layout — perfect for watching three parallel agent sessions, or comparing a `just dev` server's output against the agent that's editing it.

Three ways to pin a window to a board:

1. **Sidebar pin icon** — every window row in the sidebar has a pin icon. Click it to open a popover listing existing boards (click to pin/unpin), plus a "Pin to new board…" input that creates a new board on first pin.
2. **Command palette (`Cmd+K`)** — `Board: Pin Current Window`, `Board: Unpin Current Window`, `Board: Switch to <name>`, `Board: Leave Board View`.
3. **Board pane header** — each pinned pane shows an unpin button in its header for one-click removal.

Inside a board:

- **`Cmd+]` / `Cmd+[`** cycles pane focus to the next / previous pane (wraps).
- **Click a pane** to focus it; keystrokes route to that pane's terminal.
- **Drag the pane edge** to resize (desktop only; widths persist per-board in `localStorage`).
- **On mobile**, panes render as a single-pane swipe carousel.

Pin state lives in tmux (via the `@rk_board` window option) so it follows the window, not the browser — open the same board URL on your phone and you see the same panes. Pane widths are intentionally local to each device.

## Drive it from your phone (HTTPS over Tailscale)

Some browser features (clipboard, secure context) require HTTPS. Accessing rk from another machine on your tailnet also requires HTTPS:

1. Enable HTTPS at [DNS > HTTPS Certificates](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns).
2. Run `tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:3000`.
3. Open `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` on your phone or another laptop.

For a stable custom hostname or public access via Funnel, see the [Tailscale guide](docs/site/install.md).

## Push notifications

Any process on the box can push a real OS-level notification to your phone or
desktop — even when the RunKit PWA tab is **closed** — via Web Push:

```sh
rk notify "deploy finished" --title "CI"
```

`rk notify` POSTs to the local server, which fans the message out to every
subscribed browser using the Web Push protocol (signed with a server-side VAPID
key persisted under `~/.rk/`). It is **fail-silent**: if the server is
unreachable or returns an error it exits 0 and prints nothing, so it never
stalls a calling script or agent loop.

**Opt in from the browser**: click the **bell icon** in the top bar (or open the
command palette with `Cmd+K` and run **Notifications: Enable push**). This
requests notification permission and subscribes the current device. There is no
settings page — the bell dropdown and the palette are the opt-in gestures. The
bell dropdown also offers **Send test notification** (a local test that bypasses
the server) and a **Notifications help** link.

See the [notifications guide](docs/site/notifications.md) for setup and the
common "it says sent but nothing appears" troubleshooting (almost always an
OS-level notification block — e.g. macOS Focus mode).

> **Secure-context requirement**: Web Push (service worker + `PushManager`)
> only works in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) —
> that means **HTTPS or `localhost`**. Hitting rk on `localhost:3000` or behind
> a TLS reverse proxy (e.g. `tailscale serve`, see
> [Drive it from your phone](#drive-it-from-your-phone-https-over-tailscale))
> both qualify. Over plain HTTP to a remote host, the browser silently refuses
> to register the service worker and the **Enable push** command will report
> that a secure context is required.

## Shell completion

`rk shell-init <shell>` emits eval-safe tab-completion for your shell. Add this line to your rc file:

```sh
eval "$(rk shell-init zsh)"   # in ~/.zshrc
eval "$(rk shell-init bash)"  # in ~/.bashrc
```

Supports `zsh`, `bash`, `fish`, and `powershell`. Completion-only — rk has no shell function wrapper; every subcommand is reached via `rk <subcommand>`.

> 💡 Have other sahil87 tools? [`shll shell-install`](https://github.com/sahil87/shll#shll-shell-install--wire-the-rc-file-recommended) handles all of their shell integrations and autocompletions at once.

## Troubleshooting

- **`rk riff` fails with "not in a tmux session"** — riff requires `$TMUX` to be set. Start tmux first (`tmux new -s work`), then run `rk riff` inside it.
- **`rk riff` fails with "wt not found"** — install `wt` via `brew install sahil87/tap/wt`, or via the toolkit meta-formula `brew install sahil87/tap/all`.
- **Anything else broken** — run `rk doctor`. It checks tmux, `wt`, the launcher binary, port availability, and prints per-dependency status.

## Architecture

rk's daemon runs in a dedicated tmux server (`rk-daemon`), separate from agent sessions (`runkit`). Restarts use kill-and-restart (no polling loop or signal files), are idempotent (`--restart` works whether or not a daemon is running), and never touch agent tmux sessions — agents survive daemon restarts unaffected.
