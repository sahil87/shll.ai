# Status Dot — The Compositional Vocabulary

> [← Back to the README](https://github.com/sahil87/run-kit/blob/main/README.md#status-dots--read-every-window-at-a-glance)

> The single status dot reused on the sidebar window row, the dashboard window cards, and the
> pane-panel header. It tells the window's **local story** — what runs in this pane: which journey,
> is anyone working right now, did the pipeline fail here, does it need me — using **two
> orthogonal visual channels** plus **two additive overlay flags**: **core hue = journey**,
> **shape = liveness** (the same meaning in every hue), a **red center = the pipeline failed
> here**, and a **constant-yellow pulsing halo = the agent is waiting on you**. The **remote
> story** — the branch's PR on GitHub — lives on the row's right-edge **PR glyph**, never on the
> dot. There is no matrix to memorize: hue × shape × overlays compose freely and no cell is
> special.

Implementation: `app/frontend/src/components/status-dot.tsx` (rendering) +
`app/frontend/src/components/pr-status-model.ts` (`statusDotState` / `fabPhase` /
`PHASE_HUE` / `prOwnsGlyph` / `prGlyphColor`). Design authority:
[`docs/specs/status-pyramid.md`](https://github.com/sahil87/run-kit/blob/main/docs/specs/status-pyramid.md).

## Precedence — which input drives the dot (two families joined at the top)

The dot's core hue is owned by **two ladders joined at the top** — the first precondition that
holds wins. **Shape is liveness, derived per family**: the journey hues (blue · green · yellow)
read the window's rolled-up `agentState` ONLY (absent or stale ⇒ ring — a dev server flowing
output in a fab worktree must NOT render solid; the output-flowing fallback is the gray floor's
alone). `failed` and `waiting` are *additive overlays*, computed independently (ladder-exempt,
never tiers of their own). **No PR branch exists anywhere in the ladder** — the dot never
consults PR fields:

```
fabChange ?  (stage ∈ {intake, apply, review} ? blue-building : green-PR-ready)  [cool = fab pipeline]
          :  (fresh agentState ? yellow agent : gray floor)                      [warm = ad-hoc agent / floor]
shape     →  journey hues: solid iff agentState === "active", else ring · floor: output flowing ? solid : ring
failed    →  additive red center, over either shape (fabDisplayState === "failed" — fab hues only)
waiting   →  additive constant-yellow halo, over anything (core hue + shape kept)
```

The glance rule: **blue = still cooking, green = out the door / done, yellow core = my ad-hoc
agents, gray = just a terminal, yellow glow = needs me now, red center = my pipeline failed
here.**

1. **Cool family — fab pipeline** (the pane's worktree has an active fab change):
   - `stage ∈ {intake, apply, review}` → **blue building** (pre-PR work).
   - every other stage (`ship`, `review-pr`, `done`, unknown) → **green PR-ready** — the change has
     completed its local work ("the PR is ready"). The blue↔green split is **stage-based, never
     `prNumber`-based**; its alignment with PR existence is emergent (`/git-pr` creates the PR
     mid-ship), not a stage check.
   - shape comes from the window's rolled-up **`agentState`**, not from stage bookkeeping: a
     stage marked `active` whose agent has been idle for hours renders a **ring**, not a solid —
     solid is physically honest (`agentState` is PID-reconciled server-side, so it cannot outlive
     the process).
   - a **`skipped`** display-state makes the window *not fab-owned* — the change has left its
     journey, so the ladder simply falls through (agent tier, then floor).
2. **Warm family — ad-hoc agent** (no fab change, but a fresh `@rk_pane_agent_state`) → **yellow**
   (solid mid-turn, ring when the agent is idle or waiting — blocked is at rest by definition).
3. **Floor** (no fab change, no fresh agent) → **monochrome gray** tmux activity (solid while
   output flows, ring when quiet) — the one place output drives the shape.

## The four legend strips

![StatusDot compositional reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahil87/run-kit/main/docs/img/status-dot-reference.svg)

### 1 · Core hue = journey (4)

| Hue | Token | Hex (ref) | Means |
|-----|-------|-----------|-------|
| blue | `text-signal-blue` | `#60a5fa` (dark; `#2563eb` light) | fab **building** — intake · apply · review (pre-PR work) |
| green | `text-accent-green` | theme green | fab **PR-ready / done** — ship · review-pr · done (local work complete) |
| yellow | `text-signal-yellow` | `#facc15` (dark; `#b07d02` light) | **ad-hoc agent** — a fresh `@rk_pane_agent_state`, no fab change |
| gray | `text-text-secondary` | gray | **floor** — plain terminal; color is reserved for a journey |

The purple and orange PR hues are **retired from the dot** — purple survives in the glyph and the
PR text surfaces. The fab hue is a **two-stop progress bar, not a stage map**: exactly two fab
hues, answering "still cooking vs out the door" at a glance; the exact stage lives in the `fab`
register on the hover card and the PANE panel.

### 2 · Shape = liveness (2 — the same meaning in every hue)

| Shape | Rendering | Means |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| solid | filled circle in the core hue | **work happening NOW** — agent mid-turn (`agentState: active`, PID-reconciled); floor: output flowing |
| ring | hollow circle, 1.8px border in the core hue | **at rest** — no live worker · idle agent · waiting agent · **parked done** · quiet shell |

The shape source is **per-family**: journey hues read the rolled-up `agentState` only (absent or
stale ⇒ ring); the output-flowing signal belongs to the gray floor alone. Solid cannot outlive
its process (the server-side PID reconciler clears a dead agent's state) — but solid is **not
proof of progress**: a live-but-wedged agent stays solid until the reserved `stuck` overlay
exists.

A **parked-done change is a green resting ring** — resting, journey complete; the purple merged
glyph (when a PR exists) says how it ended. All unflagged dots render at one uniform 7px
footprint.

### 3 · Overlays = additive flags (2 — over any hue × shape; never a tier, never destructive)

| Overlay | Rendering | Means |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **failed red center** | a small (~3px) **red** center dot flagged over the base shape, at a 9px footprint | review / review-pr failed **here** (fab `fabDisplayState === "failed"`) — the only dot-red |
| **waiting halo** | a constant-yellow pulsing box-shadow ring around the dot (`rk-waiting-halo`) | an agent is **waiting on you** — blocked, therefore at rest: the halo always wraps a RING |

Failure and liveness are **orthogonal**: over a **ring**, the red center sits inside the hollow
ring ("failed, nobody on it — **act**"); over a **solid**, the flag cuts a **dark gap ring**
between the fill and the red center — a **bullseye** silhouette, so failure is never encoded in
color alone (colorblind a11y). Flagged dots keep the **9px footprint** (failure salience does not
drop); unflagged dots stay at 7px. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the halo renders as a **static
yellow ring** — attention is never encoded in motion alone.

Yellow is the agent color in both roles — **yellow core** = "an ad-hoc agent lives here",
**yellow halo** = "an agent needs you now" — the glow never claims the window is ad-hoc, because
family identity lives strictly in the core.

### 4 · PR = the right-edge row glyph (one channel, six states — never the dot)

A window with an **owned PR** (`prOwnsGlyph`: `prNumber` present with a known owned state — `open`, `merged`, or `closed`; unknown/unconfident states never own) shows a
git-pull-request glyph at the row's right edge, colored by `prGlyphColor` — first match wins, and
the order is the design:

| Color | Token | Icon | Means |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| red | `text-signal-red` | ✕ closed icon | **closed** — GitHub's closed red (matches the register's `PR_STATE_COLORS.closed`); sits above fail (stale checks are noise, and passing checks must not fall through to green); the ✕ shape separates it from a failing PR |
| purple | `text-signal-purple` | normal | merged |
| red | `text-signal-red` | normal (or draft) | checks fail / changes requested — fail stays on top of every open state; a failing draft keeps the draft shape |
| gray | `text-text-secondary` | dotted-rail draft icon | open **draft** — the only gray glyph state; muted even while its checks run (draft outranks pending) |
| yellow | `text-signal-yellow` | normal | open, **checks running** (`prChecks: pending`) |
| green | `text-accent-green` | normal | open, checks pass or no decisive signal |

A closed-unmerged PR earns the **red ✕ glyph** (its register line is unchanged) — a dead PR is a
glance-level "this window needs a decision" signal. Shape and color divide the work: closed and
failing share red and are separated by shape (✕ vs arc); draft is the only gray state and also
carries its own shape (the dotted merge rail, GitHub's draft silhouette), so it never reads as an
open PR in a dim theme or to a colorblind viewer. The icon is picked once, by `prGlyphIcon`
(✕ closed first, dotted-rail draft, arc otherwise), at every glyph site. The glyph is
deliberately **not family-gated**: any pane whose branch has an owned PR shows it — even a plain
floor pane whose dot stays gray (derivation is universal, Constitution Principle X).

## Reading a row — composed examples

Read hue, then shape, then overlays, then glyph:

| Dot | Glyph | Reads as |
|-----|-------|----------|
| blue solid | — | worker building — a fab change with a live agent mid-turn |
| blue ring + red center | — | review **failed, nobody on it — act** |
| blue bullseye (solid + gap ring + red center) | — | review failed, **rework agent live** |
| blue ring + red center, yellow halo | — | review failed and the agent is asking |
| blue ring, yellow halo | — | intake stage, agent asking |
| green ring | purple | merged and parked — archive me |
| gray solid | — | build running (floor — output flowing) |
| gray ring | — | quiet shell |

## D2 — merged / closed-PR derivation (feeds the glyph)

The backend branch→PR derivation queries **all** PR states (`gh pr list --state all`) and picks by
precedence: an **open** PR (most recently updated) wins; else the most recent **merged** PR; else
the most recent **closed** PR. A **merged** PR therefore keeps resolving positive on every pass, so
the **glyph's purple merged state is durable statelessly** — derived fresh from `gh` each cycle,
with no in-memory grace clock and nothing for an rk restart to wipe. A **closed-unmerged** PR is
still derived (it shows in the L3 register) and feeds the red ✕ glyph as well. Branch-reuse
edge: an open PR always outranks an older merged one on the same branch. (Pre-eviction this
durability fed the dot's purple done-square; the mechanism is unchanged — only its consumer moved
to the glyph.)

## Row Minimalism — glyphs on the row, detail on hover

The sidebar window row's trailing status **text** cluster — the stage word (`intake`, red when
failed) and the duration text — is **removed**; the window name gets the freed width back (less
truncation, especially on mobile). The row's status signals are glyphs only: the leading StatusDot,
plus the rest-state PR glyph above. The PR glyph is informational — it swaps out for the pin and ✕
actions the moment you hover the row.

Where each removed signal survives:

| Removed from the row | Survives as |
|----------------------|-------------|
| stage word (`review`) | the dot's core hue at a glance (blue = pre-PR, green = PR-ready); the exact stage in the hover card and the PANE panel |
| failed-red stage text | the dot's **red-center overlay** (over whichever base shape the window's liveness gives — ring + center when nobody is on it, bullseye while a rework agent is live) |
| `done`-parking suppression | the dot's green resting ring |
| PR states (merged / failing / pending / draft / closed) | the right-edge PR glyph (purple / red / yellow / gray dotted-rail / red ✕) |
| idle / elapsed duration | the hover card's `agt` register + the PANE panel register view |
| `waiting Xm` | the additive halo + the `agt` register on both surfaces |

**Hover any row for the full picture.** Resting the pointer on a window row opens a card at the
sidebar's right edge — same position every time, so it never jumps around under the pointer. It
shows the dot's own label, the four registers below, how long ago the PR status was checked, and an
"Open PR #N" link. The card also opens when you focus a row with the keyboard (Escape dismisses
it), and on a touch device by tapping the row's status dot.

**The PANE panel is the same register view for the selected window.** The four signal layers render
as separate, orthogonal lines — never collapsed — so the dot is a *pure function* of what they show
and can be mentally derived from it:

```
out  active · 4s since last output        (L0: tmux activity)
agt  waiting 3m                            (L1: @rk_pane_agent_state + epoch)
fab  260705-dmex · review · failed         (L2: fabChange · stage · displayState)
PR   #314 open · checks fail · draft        (L3: prNumber/state/checks/review/draft)
```

The register keys are fixed-width 3-char (`out`/`agt`/`fab`/`PR`), matching the panel's existing
`tmx`/`cwd`/`git` vocabulary. Absent layers render as absent (a plain shell pane shows only `out`).
The L3 PR register shows for **any** pane with a `prNumber` (universal derivation, even a plain
pane whose dot stays gray). The row's rest-state PR glyph is stricter — it renders only for an
**owned** PR; a closed PR keeps its register line and shows the red ✕ row glyph (unknown or
unconfident states still show no glyph). The **session tiles**
(the `/$server` dashboard) carry the same dot + rest-state glyph pair per window tile.

## Where red appears

- **On the dot**: only as the small red center of the **failed overlay** — inside the hollow ring
  at rest, or as the bullseye's center over a solid — never as a whole-dot color, and never as an
  attention signal (attention is the yellow halo). It is an overlay, not a shape: it composes with
  either liveness base.
- **On the glyph**: a failing PR (checks fail / changes requested) — the remote-failure signal —
  or a closed PR (the ✕ shape says which).

The two channels never share a fact: dot-red is *your pipeline failed here*, glyph-red is *the PR
is failing on GitHub or was closed there*.

## Accessibility

Every dot carries `role="img"` + `aria-label` composed from **hue word + liveness word +
flags** — a pure function of what the dot shows — so neither color nor motion is ever the sole
channel (colorblind a11y + the keyboard-first constitution). Examples: `"building — worker live"`,
`"PR-ready — at rest"`, `"building — failed — rework live"` (bullseye),
`"building — failed — at rest — agent waiting 3m"`, `"agent — idle"`; the floor uses the bare
`"active"` / `"idle"`. PR facts are deliberately absent from the label (the glyph is
`aria-hidden` decoration; the flyout card and PANE panel carry the PR detail). The halo respects
`prefers-reduced-motion` (a static yellow ring), and the same waiting fact is carried by the
duration text and the register surfaces.

## Scope notes

- **Frontend only.** The dot's inputs flow on `WindowInfo` via SSE (`fabChange`, `fabStage`,
  `fabDisplayState`, `activity`, `agentState`); the glyph reads the branch-derived PR fields. The
  backend D2 derivation (state-all precedence, default-branch carve-out #389) is unchanged.
- The shared PR color vocabulary (`PR_STATE_COLORS`, `PR_CHECKS_COLORS`, `PR_REVIEW_COLORS`) is
  preserved — it serves the glyph chain and the pane-panel PR register.
- **Accepted costs** (documented, not bugs): with a native/headless dispatch topology, real
  pipeline work whose agent lives outside the change's window reads ring — the hover-card `fab`
  register disambiguates. The window rollup is one value (`waiting > active > idle`), so a
  two-pane window with one waiting + one active agent rolls to waiting ⇒ ring + halo.
