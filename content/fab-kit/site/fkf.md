# FKF — Fab Knowledge Format (v0.1)

> **What this is.** FKF is the format fab-kit uses for the `docs/memory/` knowledge tree: a
> directory bundle of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, plus generated index and log files. FKF
> is a profile of [OKF v0.1](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
> (Open Knowledge Format, GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) — every FKF bundle is a conforming
> OKF bundle, and FKF additionally requires and fixes a handful of things OKF leaves open.
>
> **Scope: `docs/memory/` only.** FKF governs the post-implementation memory tree. It does **not**
> apply to `docs/specs/` — specs remain human-curated, frontmatter-free, and free-form per
> a fab-kit design principle (specs are human-curated).

> **Canonical standard.** This file is the canonical, authoritative FKF standard. It is maintained
> as `docs/site/fkf.md` in the [fab-kit repository](https://github.com/sahil87/fab-kit), published
> at <https://shll.ai/fab-kit/fkf>, and shipped verbatim into the kit cache as
> `$(fab kit-path)/reference/fkf.md` — the copy deployed skills cite; both homes carry identical
> bytes. Design rationale, OKF lineage, non-scope discussion, adoption/migration history, and the
> glossary live in the non-normative design companion:
> <https://github.com/sahil87/fab-kit/blob/main/docs/specs/fkf.md>. Section numbering is preserved
> from the original design doc — the gaps (§1, §4, §9–§11 are companion-only) are intentional, so
> every existing "FKF §N" citation resolves identically here.
>
> **Editing this standard.** Edit `docs/site/fkf.md` (in the fab-kit repo), then run
> `scripts/sync-fkf.sh` to refresh the shipped kit copy `src/kit/reference/fkf.md`; a CI
> drift-guard test fails on any divergence between the two files.

## 2. Conformance

A `docs/memory/` tree conforms to **FKF v0.1** if all of the following hold:

1. Every non-reserved `.md` file carries a parseable YAML frontmatter block.
2. Every such block contains `type: memory` and a non-empty `description`.
3. Reserved filenames — `index.md` and `log.md` — follow their generated structures (§5, §6) and
   are written only by `fab memory-index`.
4. Cross-links between memory files use the bundle-relative form (§7).

Items 1–2 are the OKF conformance floor (specialized: `type` is fixed, `description` is promoted
to required). Items 3–4 are FKF's added strictness. As in OKF, consumers SHOULD degrade
gracefully — a missing optional body section or an unknown extra frontmatter key does not make a
file non-conforming.

---

## 3. Concept Documents (memory files)

A memory file = a YAML frontmatter block + a markdown body, at
`docs/memory/{domain}/{name}.md` or `docs/memory/{domain}/{sub-domain}/{name}.md`.

### 3.1 `type` (required, constant)

```yaml
type: memory
```

`type` is OKF's sole required field — its machine-routing discriminator. fab's memory files are
**homogeneous** (every file is "a documented area of system behavior"), so `type` carries no
distinguishing signal and is **fixed to the constant `memory`**. The value is stamped by tooling
(the memory-file template and every memory writer), never hand-curated — so "required" costs the
author nothing.

### 3.2 `description` (required, curated)

```yaml
description: "One-line summary used by the generated domain-index row."
```

OKF *recommends* `description`; FKF **requires** it, because it is **load-bearing**: the generated
domain index reads each file's row Description from this field, and the always-load context layer
routes on it. It is the one hand-curated frontmatter field — authored by every memory writer
(hydrate, `/docs-hydrate-memory`, `/docs-reorg-memory`, `/docs-distill-memory`) and kept accurate on every edit.

**Length: a one-line index-row summary, capped at 500 characters (blocking past 1000).**
`description:` is a routing signal, not a summary of record. It MUST be a single-line frontmatter
scalar and SHOULD stay at or below **500 characters** — the unit is **characters (runes)**, measured
on the value *after quote-stripping*. Detail (requirements, design decisions, prose) belongs in the
file BODY (`## Overview`, `## Requirements`, `## Design Decisions`), never in the description. The cap
enforces in **two tiers**: `fab memory-index` emits a **non-fatal advisory** stderr warning for a
description in the **501–1000** range (over the soft cap — a trim nag that never fails
`fab memory-index --check`), and **BLOCKS** — fails `--check`, joining the blocking class below — for a
**gross over-cap** description strictly longer than **1000 characters** (2× the soft cap; the
advisory-only posture demonstrably failed — 33×/50×-cap descriptions shipped straight through the nag).

Co-locating the description with the file (rather than in the index) is deliberate: editing a
description never touches the hot, churn-prone index row. It cannot be auto-derived from the
H1/Overview without loss (Overview prose contains literal `|` pipes that break index tables, and an
extracted first sentence degrades the routing signal).

**No change-ids in `description:` (enforced/blocking).** The description MUST NOT carry change-ids —
neither a trailing `— xu0k`-style suffix nor a `(d9rs)`-style citation. It is a routing signal, not a
provenance record; change-id citations belong in the body (§3.3), never in the description. This ban
is **enforced**: `fab memory-index` **BLOCKS** (fails `--check`, joining the blocking class below) on a
`description:` carrying a **registry-gated** change-id — a full `YYMMDD-XXXX-slug` folder-name token
whose registered folder matches, or a bare registered 4-char id (the same false-positive-free registry
gating the `log.md` change-id attribution uses, so `code`/`yaml`/any unregistered 4-char word never
trips it). Detection covers topic files and domain/sub-domain `index.md` stubs alike.

> **Blocking content class (§3.2 escalations + malformed frontmatter).** Because the index reads the
> `description:` frontmatter verbatim, an *offending* description silently propagates into the
> generated row (the drift check alone cannot catch it — committed byte-identical to regenerated).
> `fab memory-index` treats **four** signatures as **BLOCKING** — they make `fab memory-index --check`
> **fail (exit ≥ 1) independent of index drift**, enumerating the offending file(s): (a) an
> **unclosed frontmatter block** (opens `---` with no subsequent standalone `---`); (b) a
> `description:` value that **starts with a quote but fails quote-stripping** (an unterminated quote,
> e.g. a closing fence glued on as `"…text…"---`); (c) a **registry-gated change-id** in
> `description:` (the §3.2 ban above); and (d) a **gross over-cap** `description:` (> 1000 characters).
> This is a **blocking** signal distinct from the advisory warnings (the 501–1000 length nag, plus the
> per-topic-file debt meters — narration density, file size, `_unsorted/` non-empty, and broken
> bundle-relative links — which never affect the exit code) and from the destructive-loss tier (§6.4):
> each is fixed by editing the offending file (repair the frontmatter, or trim/de-cite the
> `description:`), not by a reorg, so it is **not** a `--check` tier-2 category and does not fire the
> refuse-before-regen guards (which key on exit == 2; exit 2 still wins when a tier-2 loss co-occurs).
> Validation is stderr/exit-code only — it never changes the rendered index bytes.

### 3.3 Body (conventional headings, recommended — not mandated)

The body is standard markdown. FKF adopts OKF's posture: **conventional headings are recommended
where they apply, not required**. A file is conforming without any particular section. The
conventional structure:

```markdown
---
type: memory
description: "One-line summary used by the generated domain-index row."
---
# {File Name}

**Domain**: {domain}

## Overview
<!-- 1-2 sentences describing what this file covers. -->

## Requirements
### Requirement: {Name}
{RFC 2119 text: MUST / SHALL / SHOULD / MAY}

#### Scenario: {Name}
- **GIVEN** {precondition}
- **WHEN** {action}
- **THEN** {expected outcome}

## Design Decisions
### {Decision Title}
**Decision**: {chosen approach}
**Why**: {rationale}
**Rejected**: {alternative and why it was worse}
*Introduced by*: {change-name}
```

The pipeline's hydrate step *writes into* `## Requirements` and `## Design Decisions`, and
review/intake *read from* them — so these headings remain the target shape and SHOULD be used
wherever the content warrants. But a small reference-pointer file need not invent a GIVEN/WHEN/THEN
scenario: the rule is *SHOULD-use-these-conventional-headings-where-they-apply*, not
*MUST-have-these-sections*.

**Body style: state current truth in present tense (normative).** The body describes **what IS**,
not how it came to be:

- **Present tense, current truth.** Every statement describes the current contract. A memory file
  is a statement of record, not an accumulated log of edits.
- **No transition narration.** Never narrate a change *as* a change — no "renamed X→Y in {id}", no
  "this inverts/supersedes {id}'s claim", no "was `old.value`". Describe the current value; the
  previous one is not the body's concern.
- **Superseded behavior is never described in the body.** The previous state belongs to the
  per-folder generated `log.md` (§6, the dated *what*), git history (the diff), and archived change
  folders (the full design) — the body carries only what IS. Consolidating a section to current
  truth (dropping the superseded description) is the correct edit, not a loss. (Sole sanctioned
  exception: `_shared/removed-domains.md`, whose body *is* removal records — a citation-carrying
  tombstone ledger, not transition narration — protected by the `fab memory-index --check` tier-2
  tombstone-loss guard and the `docs-reorg-memory` carve-out that authors it.)
- **Provenance is citation-only, and headings carry none.** The sole permitted provenance in a body
  is a trailing `(change-id)` citation and the `*Introduced by*: {change-name}` field on a Design
  Decision. A citation marks *where a current fact came from*; it does not narrate a transition.
  Citations are deliberately preserved — a 6-char `(id)` cheaply defends a deliberate,
  easily-"fixed"-away behavior against future regressions. **Heading text names its topic, never a
  change**: a heading is `## Dispatch States`, never `### Dispatch States (xu0k)` or
  `## xu0k — dispatch states`. Change-ids appear only as trailing citations in body text — never in
  heading text.
- **No operational TODOs.** Follow-up work items — TODOs, "still needs X", next-step checklists — are
  never memory-body content. They belong in the project backlog (`fab/backlog.md`) or the originating
  change folder. A memory body states what IS, not what remains to be done.
- **Rationale survives distillation — as Design Decisions entries.** "Don't re-break this" content
  lives in Design Decisions' `Why` / `Rejected` as durable, present-tense design intent — a rejected
  alternative is a design *fact*, not transition narration. Token savings come from dropping
  narration, **never** rationale. Any *why*, rejected alternative, or constraint explanation goes
  into a `## Design Decisions` entry in the four-field shape (**Decision** / **Why** / **Rejected** /
  *Introduced by*), never as inline narration in Overview/Requirements prose. The **changelog-bullet
  shape is banned inside `## Design Decisions`**: an entry like `- **{change-id} — retired X**` is
  change history (`log.md`'s job, §6), not a design decision — a DD entry heading is a decision
  *title*, never a change-id.

> **No `## Changelog` section.** Per-file changelog tables are **removed** in FKF — change history
> lives in the per-folder generated `log.md` (§6). This is the single biggest FKF divergence from
> the pre-FKF memory format.

### 3.4 Optional frontmatter

FKF neither requires nor forbids the other OKF-recommended fields (`title`, `tags`,
`timestamp`, `resource`). `resource` (a URI to an underlying asset) is typically **absent** —
memory files document *behavior*, not addressable assets. Per OKF, consumers MUST preserve
unknown frontmatter keys on round-trip and MUST NOT reject a file for carrying them.

---

## 5. Index Files (`index.md`) — generated

Every directory holding ≥1 non-index `.md` carries a generated `index.md`. **All index tiers are
generated artifacts written solely by `fab memory-index`** — agents never hand-edit index rows.
The render is a pure function of folder contents + each file's `description:` frontmatter — so
the output is **byte-stable / idempotent**: two branches cannot produce conflicting
hand-edits to the same row, and any residual textual conflict auto-resolves by re-running
`fab memory-index` post-merge.

> FKF is stricter than OKF here: OKF permits hand-written, auto-generated, *or*
> consumer-synthesized indexes. FKF **forbids** hand-editing — generation is the single writer.

Three tiers:

- **Root** (`docs/memory/index.md`) — **domains-only**: `| Domain | Description |`. Each domain
  row's Description is read from that domain `index.md`'s `description:` frontmatter
  (round-tripped by the generator). No inlined per-file column (it silently drifts).
- **Domain** (`docs/memory/{domain}/index.md`) — file rows: `| File | Description |`.
  Description from each topic file's frontmatter. The index carries no dates — it is a pure
  function of content, so it is branch-independent and idempotent (recency lives in `log.md`).
  Carries its own `description:` frontmatter (the source for the root row). When sub-domains exist, appends a
  `## Sub-Domains` table (`| Sub-Domain | Description |`) — emitted **only when sub-domains
  exist**, so a flat domain index is byte-identical to a sub-domain-free one.
- **Sub-domain** (`docs/memory/{domain}/{sub-domain}/index.md`) — same file-row contract as a
  domain index; carries its own `description:` frontmatter (the source for the parent's
  `## Sub-Domains` row).

The **one curated input** to index generation is the `description:` frontmatter on topic files
and on domain/sub-domain index files. Everything else in an index is derived.

> **Stub-before-index.** When a new domain/sub-domain is created, its `index.md` **stub**
> (carrying only `description:` frontmatter) is written **before** `fab memory-index` runs; the
> command fills the generated body and round-trips the description. This is the Index Ownership
> model — it avoids the contradiction of one step hand-editing an index the next step both
> generates and forbids editing.

### Merge policy: regenerate, never hand-merge (normative)

Because an `index.md` (and a `log.md`, §6) is a pure function of its folder's contents, two branches
that both touch a folder produce **conflicting edits to the same generated rows**. On any merge
conflict in a generated `docs/memory/**/index.md` or `log.md`, agents **MUST NOT hand-merge the
generated file.** The procedure is mechanical:

1. Resolve the conflicts in the **topic files** only (and any `.status.yaml` / `log.seed.md` seed
   inputs the generation reads) — never in the `index.md` / `log.md` itself.
2. **Re-run `fab memory-index`.**
3. Take its output **wholesale** as the resolution (`git add` the regenerated index/log files).

`fab memory-index --check` at review-pr backstops staleness. Byte-stability makes the
regenerate-wholesale resolution *always correct*, so there is never a reason to reconcile a
generated file by hand.

> **Optional `.gitattributes` merge-driver (non-normative aside — documentation only).** A project MAY
> reduce the friction by registering a custom merge driver that resolves generated index/log conflicts
> by taking either side and deferring to the next `fab memory-index` regen. It is **not auto-installed**
> (no tooling change, no migration) — a convenience opted into by hand:
>
> ```gitattributes
> docs/memory/**/index.md merge=fab-regen
> docs/memory/**/log.md   merge=fab-regen
> ```
> ```sh
> git config merge.fab-regen.name "fab memory-index regenerates this"
> git config merge.fab-regen.driver "true"   # accept either side; regen fixes it
> ```
>
> The driver only *suppresses the conflict marker*; the mandatory `fab memory-index` re-run (step 2)
> then produces the correct bytes — it does **not** replace the regenerate step.

**`fkf_version` on the root index** — see §8.

## 6. Log Files (`log.md`) — generated (C-lite)

Each domain and sub-domain folder carries a generated `log.md` recording that folder's change
history. **`log.md` is a generated artifact written solely by `fab memory-index`** (same
single-writer, byte-stable discipline as `index.md`). It replaces the per-file `## Changelog`
tables that FKF removes from memory files (§3.3).

### 6.1 The C-lite model

`log.md` is assembled from **two sources**, neither of which any agent hand-edits:

1. **Git history**, keyed to the folder — the *when*, the *which file*, and the change ID. This is
   a projection of `git log` (the sole consumer of the batched git pass, now that the index is
   dateless), so it is always accurate and never conflicts.
2. **A per-change one-line summary** — the *what*, written **once** into the change's own
   `.status.yaml` `summary:` field (§6.3). Because each change touches only *its own*
   `.status.yaml`, the summary has **zero conflict surface**.

The generator joins them: for each commit touching a file in the folder, it emits one entry
under that commit's date, carrying the file, the change's `summary`, and the change ID.

### 6.2 Format

```markdown
# Log — {domain}
<!-- Generated by `fab memory-index` from git history + per-change summaries. Do not hand-edit. -->

## 2026-06-13
- **Update** [migrations](/distribution/migrations.md) — surfaces the optional `agent.tiers`
  per-stage-model override as a fully-commented config reference block; additive, no schema change. (260613-l3ja)

## 2026-06-12
- **Update** [migrations](/distribution/migrations.md) — drops the dead `stage_directives:` block. (260612-c5tr)
- **Update** [migrations](/distribution/migrations.md) — path-cite conformance; no migration shipped. (260612-tb6f)
```

- Entries are **date-grouped, newest first**; ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date headings (OKF convention).
- Each entry: an optional leading bold verb (`**Update**` / `**Creation**` / `**Deprecation**` —
  OKF-conventional, derived from the change's `change_type` / removal markers), a bundle-relative
  link to the file that changed, the change's `summary`, and the `(change-id)` in parens.
- The descriptive line is **one line per change per file** — deliberately not the paragraph-length
  prose the pre-FKF changelog rows carried. Durable, long-form *why* belongs in the memory file's
  `## Design Decisions` section (it is durable design intent, not dated history); `log.md` carries
  the dated *what*.

### 6.3 The `summary:` source field

The per-change summary line lives in the change's `.status.yaml`:

```yaml
summary: "surfaces the optional agent.tiers per-stage-model override as a commented config block"
```

- Written once during the change (authored at hydrate, or carried from the intake), via the fab
  CLI — single-change-touched, so conflict-free.
- Read by `fab memory-index` when generating `log.md`.
- Absence degrades gracefully: a change with no `summary` projects with the change slug in place of
  the descriptive line.

## 7. Cross-links — bundle-relative

Links between memory files use the **bundle-relative absolute** form: a path beginning with `/`,
interpreted relative to the bundle root (`docs/memory/`).

```markdown
See [migrations](/distribution/migrations.md) and [configuration](/_shared/configuration.md).
```

> FKF picks OKF's *recommended* link form (over plain relative) for a concrete reason:
> `docs-reorg-memory` **moves files between domains** (splits/merges). Bundle-relative links
> survive a move — the reorg skill rewrites *far* fewer links — whereas plain relative links
> break on every move and must be rewritten in bulk. As in OKF, the relationship *type*
> (parent/child, references, depends-on) is conveyed by surrounding prose, not a typed link
> field, and consumers MUST tolerate broken links (a missing target is not malformed).

Links **out** of the bundle (to source files, specs, external URLs) use ordinary repo-relative
or absolute-URL forms as appropriate — the bundle-relative rule governs memory↔memory links.

---

## 8. Versioning

The bundle declares its FKF version in the **root `index.md` frontmatter** — the only `index.md`
permitted to carry frontmatter beyond the generator's own output:

```yaml
---
fkf_version: "0.1"
---
```

FKF emits **`fkf_version`**, not OKF's `okf_version`, because an FKF bundle is a *superset* of
OKF — claiming bare `okf_version` would under-state what the bundle guarantees. `fab memory-index`
writes `fkf_version` into the root index on generation.

Minor versions add backward-compatible features; major versions may break. Per OKF, consumers
SHOULD attempt best-effort consumption rather than refusing an unknown version.
